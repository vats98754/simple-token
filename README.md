# simple-token
Solidity token smart contract
This Solidity contract defines a basic token called SimpleToken. It has a name, a symbol, a total supply, and a mapping to keep track of token balances for each address. The contract supports the transfer function, which allows users to transfer tokens from their own address to another address.

To use this contract, you'll need to compile and deploy it using a Solidity development environment like Remix or Truffle. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract by calling the transfer function to transfer tokens between addresses.

Please note that this is a simplified example for educational purposes, and it lacks some important features like security checks and allowances. In a real-world scenario, you would need to add additional functionality and safeguards to make it secure and practical for use.
